Warehouse Management System - Project Description
Overview
The Warehouse Management System is a Windows Forms application developed using C#, Entity Framework Core (Code-First Approach), and SQL Server. This system helps a trading company efficiently manage multiple warehouses, track inventory, process supply and withdrawal orders, and facilitate the transfer of goods between different warehouses.

Key Features
âœ… Warehouse Management: Add and manage multiple warehouses, each with a unique name and location.
âœ… Item Management: Store detailed information about items, including name, category, and expiration date.
âœ… Inventory Tracking: Monitor the stock levels of items across different warehouses.
âœ… Supplier & Customer Management: Maintain records of suppliers and customers for smooth transactions.
âœ… Supply Orders: Track incoming inventory from suppliers, including the quantity and manufacturing details.
âœ… Withdrawal Orders: Manage outgoing inventory for customers and track stock depletion.
âœ… Transfers Between Warehouses: Transfer stock from one warehouse to another with proper documentation.
âœ… Reporting & Analysis: Generate reports on stock levels, expired items, and movement history.

Database Structure & Relationships
The system follows a relational database model with the following main relationships:

Warehouse (1) â†’ (M) WarehouseItems (M) â†’ (1) Item
Warehouse (1) â†’ (M) SupplyOrder
Supplier (1) â†’ (M) SupplyOrder
SupplyOrder (1) â†’ (M) SupplyOrderDetails (M) â†’ (1) Item
Warehouse (1) â†’ (M) WithdrawalOrder
Customer (1) â†’ (M) WithdrawalOrder
WithdrawalOrder (1) â†’ (M) WithdrawalOrderDetails (M) â†’ (1) Item
Warehouse (1) â†’ (M) TransferOrder (M) â†’ (1) Warehouse
TransferOrder (1) â†’ (M) TransferOrderDetails (M) â†’ (1) Item
Supplier (1) â†’ (M) TransferOrderDetails
